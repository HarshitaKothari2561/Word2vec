and services and execute \n","works to fulfil their duties and responsibilities. To improve good governance, \n","transparency, fairness, competition, and value for money in public procurement, the \n","Government of India has taken a number of significant policy initiatives in public \n","procurement in the recent past. The General Financial Rules were revised \n","comprehensively in March 2017, covering inter-alia this set of new initiatives. \n","Consequently, the Manual for Procurement of Goods, 2017; Manual for Procurement of \n","Consultancy and Other Services, 2017 and Manual for Procurement of Works, 2019 \n","were also developed. \n","2. \n","Tender documents are the ultimate vehicle for implementing such policy \n","initiatives on the ground. If all procurements use a uniform set of tender documents, the \n","impact of policy initiatives' gets amplified, bringing economies of scale and increased \n","competition. Bidders also get broader market access for their products. \n","3. \n","Therefore, this Model Tender Document (MTD) has been developed for the \n","procurement of Goods.This MTD rationalises and simplifies the usual structure of tender \n","documents. Besides aligning its provisions with various procurement policies, it \n","incorporates national and international best practices and breaks some new grounds. In \n","two stages, extensive consultations were done with Ministries/ Departments/ Central \n","Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs), other organisations and individuals to develop this \n","document.  A unique feature of this MTD is its availability as a software template which \n","can be customised with the names and requirements of user organisations. \n","4. \n","Detailed guidance is provided at appropriate places in the MTD, and a separate \n","detailed Guidance Note is also attached to help the procuring officials. \n","5. \n","MTDs issued by this Department are to be taken as guiding templates. Ministries/ \n","Departments are advised to suitably customise this document to suit their local/ \n","specialised needs. Government e-Marketplace (GeM), Central Public Procurement \n","Portal (CPPP) and other e-procurement portals should host this MTD on their portals so \n","as to help procuring entities to customise and make use of the MTD. This is first edition \n","of the MTD and this Department welcomes any suggestion or comment on this \n","document for further improvement. \n","6.  \n","I would like to acknowledge the lead taken by Shri Sanjay Aggarwal, Advisor \n","(PPD), Shri Kanwalpreet, Director (PPD) and the role of Shri Girish Bhatnagar, \n","Consultant (Public Procurement) in the development of this Model Tender Document. I \n","\n","would also like to thank Ministries, Departments, other organisations, and individuals \n","who reviewed the drafts of the Model Tender Document and provided their valuable \n","inputs. \n","7. \n","I hope that this Model Tender Document would help procuring officials working in \n","various Ministries/ Departments and Public Enterprises as a guiding template, deepen \n","the impact of policy initiatives mentioned above and improve the ease of doing business \n","with the Government. \n"," \n"," \n","(Dr T V Somanathan) \n","Finance Secretary & Secretary (Expenditure) \n","29.10.2021 \n","\n"," \n","  \n","Procuring Organisation \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n","Tender Document \n","Tender Reference Number: Tend No./ xxxx \n","For Procurement of  \n","GOODS \n","\n"," \n"," \n"," \n","\n","[ii] \n"," \n"," \n"," \n","Procuring Organisation \n"," \n"," \n","Document Authentication \n","IPR \n","PPD, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance \n","Government of India \n","Updated upto \n","31-10-2021 \n","Version: \n","Final V01 \n","File Name  \n","Goods - Model Tender Document final 31102021.docx \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n","Procuring Organisation \n","Tender Document \n","Tender Reference Number: Tend No./ xxxx \n","For Procurement of  \n","GOODS \n","\n"," \n","For Internal Official only - Not for Bidders \n","{As a convention, all grey text in italics within curly brackets {e.g., this paragraph} must be \n","deleted before publishing.

Then the price of L-1 \n","shall be counter-offered to the higher quoting responsive Bidders (under intimation \n","to L-1), asking them to send their revised Bids online on the e-procurement portal \n","to be opened at a specified place, date, and time (as per the standard procedure). \n","L-1 Bidder would be specifically informed that it may, if it so desires, reduce its \n","price and send its revised Bid accordingly.

Applicability \n","1.1 \n","This document is advisory and aims to facilitate Procuring Entities in preparing \n","Tender Document for Procurement of Goods. The document is based on General Financial \n","Rules 2017, Manual for Procurement of Goods 2017 as amended until publishing. This \n","document does not intend to replace alternative Tender Document as agreed (if any) with \n","the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), i.e. The World Bank, Asian Development Bank \n","etc., for procurements financed by loans/ grants extended by such MDBs. \n","1.2 \n","This Document is for use by Central Government Ministries/ Departments and their \n","attached and subordinate offices, Central Public Sector Entities, Autonomous Bodies and \n","Statutory Bodies. There is no restriction on its adoption by State Governments or other \n","agencies \n","1.3 \n","Major Goods procuring Ministries/ Departments inter-alia Ministry of Defence; \n","Ministry of Railways and certain large CPSEs, who have well-established Tender \n","Documents for their unique individual requirement may continue to use such documents. \n","They may, however, use this document for guidance to revise their documents. \n","1.4 \n","The Model Tender Document is generic for open tenders through the GePNIC portal. \n","It is not suitable for procurement below the threshold for Open Tender (Rs 25 Lakh, or any \n","other amount in your Schedule of Powers), which require only a short Tender Document. \n","2. Nomenclature Conundrum \n","There is no standardised nomenclature in Public Procurement in India, and a mix of \n","American, European, and British/ Indian nomenclature has become common. ‘Tender’ is \n","taken to mean (i) ‘Tender Document’ or ‘Tender Process’ as well as (ii) the ‘Bid’ submitted by \n","the bidders. The Tender Document floated by Procuring Entity is also called a Bid \n","Document. Similarly, participants in a Tender are alternatively called tenderers and bidders. \n","This duality is reflected in “Notice Inviting Tenders’ and ‘Instructions to Bidders’ etc.  \n","Although this is not an appropriate forum to discuss this topic in detail that it deserves, an \n","attempt is made to standardise for this document ‘Tender’ for the (i) above and Bid for (ii) \n","and hence Bidder is used instead of Tenderer, and the document is being called ‘Tender \n","Document’ instead of ‘Bid Document’. Similar attempts are made to standardise other \n","nomenclature in this document without disturbing the nomenclature embedded in the CPPP \n","portal. \n","3. The process to modify Custom fields in the generic Model Tender \n","Document to suit your Organisation and a specific procurement \n","3.1 \n","Certain generic variables used throughout the document are embedded as the \n","Custom fields in the word file. These fields (refer para 4 and 6 below) can be changed in one \n","go throughout the document (including headers and footers) to suit your Organisation. The \n","process to change these fields in the Model Tender Document file is as follows: \n","a) Click ‘File’ (top left) menu, and in the “File’ menu, select ‘Info’ (4th from top) on the \n","left side panel  \n","\n"," \n","Guidance Note for the Goods - Model Tender Document \n","[ii] \n"," \n"," \n","b) On the right-side panel of Info is ‘Properties’ and dropdown to click ‘Advance \n","Properties’ \n"," \n","c) Select the ‘Custom’ tab in ‘Advanced Properties’.  \n","d) Select the specific property in the custom tab and ‘Modify’ in the ‘value’ box and click \n","‘OK’ to save. \n"," \n","e) Make such changes to all the fields to be changed. \n","f) To populate these changed fields throughout the document (including headers or \n","footers): from the editing menu, ‘select all’ (or Ctrl+A to select all text) to select the \n","whole document. \n","g) Press F9 to update all fields (some computers need Fn+F9). Verify if changes have \n","occurred in the document. \n","h) Save the Model Tender Document file under a new name. \n","\n","Procurement of GOODS \n"," \n","Guidance Note for the Goods - Model Tender Document \n","[iii] \n"," \n","4. Customise Model Tender Document to serve as a Model Tender Document \n","for your Organisation. \n","Firstly, customise the Model Tender Document to reflect the custom fields that would apply \n","to all future procurements so that the document becomes a Model Tender Document for \n","your Organisation. These are: \n","a) Name of Custom Field and existing value: ‘On behalf of’ and ‘President of India’ (‘the’ \n","article is in the text). In the Central Government entities, tenders are invited on behalf \n","of the ‘President of India’. No change is required for such entities. In the case of \n","CPSE or States, this may be suitably changed to the ‘Chairman and Managing \n","Director (CMD)’ or the ‘Governor of --------‘. \n","b) Name of Custom Field and existing value: ‘Procuring Organisation’ and ‘Procuring \n","Organisation’. The actual name of the Organisation can be substituted here (e.g., \n","Department of Expenditure). \n","c) Name of Custom Field and existing value: ‘The Legal Head’ and ‘Head of the \n","Procuring Organisation’. The Head of the Organisation usually is the authority that \n","appoints Arbitrators and Conciliators. The authority's actual designation (for such \n","appointments) can be substituted here (e.g., Jt Secretary). \n","d) Name of Custom Field and existing value: ‘Procuring Entity’ and ‘Procuring Entity’. \n","This entity floats the Tender. The actual name of such entity can be substituted here \n","(e.g., Procurement Policy Division). \n","e) Name of Custom Field and existing value: ‘Head of Procurement’ and ‘Head of \n","Procurement’. The Head of the Procuring Entity is usually the competent financial \n","authority for procurement matters. The authority's actual designation (for such \n","procurement powers) can be substituted here (e.g., General Manager Procurement). \n","f) Name of Custom Field and existing value: ‘eProcurement URL’ and \n","‘https://eprocure.gov.in/eprocure/app’. This field is the URL address of the e-\n","Procurement portal used by the Organisation. If different than this, the actual URL \n","used by the Organisation can be substituted here. \n","g) Name of Custom Field and existing value: ‘Tender Inviting Authority’ and ‘Tender \n","Inviting Authority’. This officer (named TIA in the portal) uploads the Tender \n","Document and is the nodal officer interacting with the e-Procurement portal. If more \n","than one TIAs are there, then do this modification for each specific procurement \n","document and not in the Organisation’s Model Tender Document. Otherwise, actual \n","designation (for such function) can be substituted here (e.g., Dy. Manager). \n","h) Since such changes are not likely to page pagination, there is no need to update the \n","Table of Content. \n","i) After making these modifications save the file under a suitable name as the Model \n","Tender Document for your Organisation. This Model RfP can be used in all future \n","procurements of Goods in the Organisation. \n","5. Customise Model Tender Document for a specific Type of Tender Process \n","5.1 \n","The Model Tender Document, and as it stands, is customised for Single Stage, Two \n","Covers, Domestic Open Tenders through GePNIC eProcurement of general Goods. \n","With suitable customisation, it can be used for Capital Goods, Rate-Contract, Tender-cum-\n","Auction; Single Cover, or the second stage of two-stage/ Pre-Qualification Bidding (PQB) \n","after shortlisting of qualified bidders in the EoI/ PQB stage. \n","5.2 \n","As a convention, in the Model Tender Document, all grey text in italics within curly \n","brackets {as at the beginning of TIS} must be deleted before publishing. All grey text in italics \n","\n"," \n","Guidance Note for the Goods - Model Tender Document \n","[iv] \n"," \n","within square/ box brackets [as in the tabular entries in TIS] must be replaced by appropriate \n","information. \n","5.3 \n","Instead of two Covers system of tendering, a Single Cover system \n","Make changes in the following sections of the Model Tender Document: \n","a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) – in 1.0 Basic Details – No. of Covers \n","b) Section III: AITB – in ITB 12.2.2 \n","5.3 \n","Instead of a Single-Stage Bidding system, the second stage of two-stage/ Pre-\n","Qualification Bidding (PQB) after shortlisting of qualified bidders in the EoI/ PQB \n","stage \n","Make changes in the following sections of the Model Tender Document: \n","a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) – in 1.0 Basic Details – Bidding System \n","b) Section III: AITB – in ITB 12.2.2 \n","5.4 \n","instead of Open Tender - Domestic a Global Tender Enquiry \n","Make changes in the following sections of the Model Tender Document: \n","a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) – in 1.0 Basic Details – Tender Type \n","b) Section III: AITB – in ITB 6.1.6 and 12.4.2. Here any other detail like currencies \n","allowed to be quoted etc., may be added. \n","5.5 \n","If an e-Reverse auction is to follow the usual Financial Bid opening in Tender-\n","cum-Auction System \n","Make changes in the following sections of the Model Tender Document: \n","a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) – in 1.0 Basic Details – e-Reverse Auction \n","b) Section III: AITB – in ITB 12.4.3. Here any other relevant details may be added. \n","5.6 \n","Procurement of Capital Goods/ Machinery and Plant \n","Special provisions are needed in case of such procurements. Make changes in the following \n","sections of the Model Tender Document: \n","a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) – in 1.0 Basic Details – Tender Category \n","b) Section III: AITB – in ITB 6.1.3. Here any other relevant details may be added. \n","c) Section V: SCC – in GCC 6.1, 6.6, 6.7. Also, mention any incidental works/ services \n","required, e.g., installation, commissioning, operator’s training, AMC etc. \n","5.7 \n","For entering into Rate Contracts \n","Special provisions are needed in case of such procurements. Make changes in the following \n","sections of the Model Tender Document: \n","a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) – in 1.0 Basic Details – Tender Type \n","b) Section III: AITB – in ITB 13.1.3. Here any other relevant details may be added. \n","c) Section V: SCC – GCC 10.1.6 – invoke applicability of fall clause. \n","6. Modify Custom Fields in Model Tender Document for a specific \n","procurement \n","a) Name of Custom Field and existing value: ‘Tender Inviting Authority’ and ‘Tender \n","Inviting Authority’. If your Organisation has different TIAs for different tenders, then \n","the actual designation of the TIA should be modified for each specific procurement, \n","as per para 4 g) above. Otherwise, don’t change this field. \n","b) Name of Custom Field and existing value: ‘Subject Matter of Procurement’ and \n","‘GOODS’. A short description of the Goods being procured is mentioned in the \n","headers and at other places in the Tender Document. Substitute here the short \n","description of Goods being procured (e.g., Printer Paper A4, white, 75 gsm). The \n","\n","Procurement of GOODS \n"," \n","Guidance Note for the Goods - Model Tender Document \n","[v] \n"," \n","Rate Contract tender process should mention ‘To enter into Rate Contracts for the \n","supply of (name of the Goods)’.  \n","c) Name of Custom Field and existing value: ‘Document Number’ and ‘Tend No./ xxxx’. \n","Tender (Reference) Number is mentioned in the headers and at other places in the \n","Tender Document. Substitute the actual Tender Number here. You would not have to \n","type this information repeatedly. \n","7. Filling data for a specific procurement \n","7.1 \n","Portions that need not be modified for a specific procurement: A significant \n","portion (75%) of the Model Tender Document need not be modified for a specific \n","procurement. These portions are: \n","a) Section I: Notice Inviting Tender (NIT):. The NIT provides sufficient information to \n","Bidders to help in deciding on participation. It gets customised through the custom \n","fields as in para 4 and 6 above. It is designed to separate variable information in its \n","appendix – Tender Information Summary (TIS). TIS also serves as a central \n","repository of Tender parameters along with AITB (Appendix to ITB). Therefore, the \n","NIT does not require modification for a specific procurement. \n","b) Section II: Instructions to Bidders (ITB) – It provides instructions and information to \n","Bidders regarding the Tender Process upto Letter of Award (LoA). ITB need not be \n","changed since any changes required are to be entered in Section III: Appendix to ITB \n","(AITB). \n","c) Section IV: General Conditions of Contract (GCC). It contains standard conditions of \n","the contract. It is designed to be self-contained without reference to other sections, \n","except SCC. GCC need not be changed since any changes required are to be \n","entered in Section V: Special Conditions of Contract (SCC). \n","d) All Bidding Forms are to be filled by the Bidders and hence should be left unchanged. \n","e) All Formats also are to be left unchanged \n","7.2 \n","Portions to be filled in for a specific procurement: A small portion (approx. 10%) \n","of the Model Tender Document need to be modified for a specific procurement. These are: \n","f) Tender Information Summary (TIS, appendix to NIT) contains variable information of \n","the NIT. It supplements AITB in providing salient parameters of Tender in tabular \n","form, which used to be earlier interspersed all over the older Tender Documents. \n","Sufficient guidance is written in the TIS to guide you in filling it. Also, see para 5 \n","above. \n","g) Section III: AITB modifies the standard provisions of ITB. Sufficient guidance is \n","written in the AITB to guide you in filling it. Also, see para 5 above.  \n","h) Section V: SCC modifies the standard provisions of GCC. Sufficient guidance is \n","written in the SCC to guide you in filling it. Also, see para 5 above. \n","i) There are specific clauses that act like double-edged swords and are appropriate \n","only for restricted procurement situations. Their use in regular procurement may \n","enhance risk perception (and quoted prices) by the Bidder without any \n","commensurate benefit to the Procuring Entity.

The Bidder \n","would hedge his prices for the perceived costs and disruptions. \n","• \n","GCC-clause 5.12 (Labour Codes and Related Obligations): This usually is not \n","relevant in the procurement of Goods, except rarely in large Capital Goods \n","procurements, involving a significant presence of contractor’s personnel \n","during installation and testing. \n","• \n","GCC-clause 6.5 (Quantity Option clause): This may be useful for repetitive \n","annual/ long-term procurements, where quantity forecast has large variability. \n","In inappropriate situations, the Bidder may hedge his prices for the \n","uncertainty in quantity. \n","• \n","GCC-clause 10.1.6 (Fall clause): This may be useful in long-term \n","procurements (e.g. Rate-contracts) for goods procured by many agencies or \n","where prices typically decrease due to technological trends.

ministries departments interalia ministry of defence ministry of railways and certain large cpses who have wellestablished tender documents for their unique individual requirement may continue to use such documents they may however use this document for guidance to revise their documents 14 the model tender document is generic for open tenders through the gepnic portal it is not suitable for procurement below the threshold for open tender rs 25 lakh or any other amount in your schedule of powers which require only a short tender document 2 nomenclature conundrum there is no standardised nomenclature in public procurement in india and a mix of american european and british indian nomenclature has become common ‘tender’ is taken to mean i ‘tender document’ or ‘tender process’ as well as ii the ‘bid’ submitted by the bidders the tender document floated by procuring entity is also called a bid document similarly participants in a tender are alternatively called tenderers and bidders this duality is reflected in “notice inviting tenders’ and ‘instructions to bidders’ etc although this is not an appropriate forum to discuss this topic in detail that it deserves an attempt is made to standardise for this document ‘tender’ for the i above and bid for ii and hence bidder is used instead of tenderer and the document is being called ‘tender document’ instead of ‘bid document’ similar attempts are made to standardise other nomenclature in this document without disturbing the nomenclature embedded in the cppp portal 3 the process to modify custom fields in the generic model tender document to suit your organisation and a specific procurement 31 certain generic variables used throughout the document are embedded as the custom fields in the word file these fields refer para 4 and 6 below can be changed in one go throughout the document including headers and footers to suit your organisation the process to change these fields in the model tender document file is as follows a click ‘file’ top left menu and in the “file’ menu select ‘info’ 4th from top on the left side panel guidance note for the goods model tender document ii b on the rightside panel of info is ‘properties’ and dropdown to click ‘advance properties’ c select the ‘custom’ tab in ‘advanced properties’ d select the specific property in the custom tab and ‘modify’ in the ‘value’ box and click ‘ok’ to save e make such changes to all the fields to be changed f to populate these changed fields throughout the document including headers or footers from the editing menu ‘select all’ or ctrla to select all text to select the whole document g press f9 to update all fields some computers need fnf9 verify if changes have occurred in the document h save the model tender document file under a new name procurement of goods guidance note for the goods model tender document iii 4 customise model tender document to serve as a model tender document for your organisation firstly customise the model tender document to reflect the custom fields that would apply to all future procurements so that the document becomes a model tender document for your organisation these are a name of custom field and existing value ‘on behalf of’ and ‘president of india’ ‘the’ article is in the text in the central government entities tenders are invited on behalf of the ‘president of india’ no change is required for such entities in the case of cpse or states this may be suitably changed to the ‘chairman and managing director cmd’ or the ‘governor of ‘ b name of custom field and existing value ‘procuring organisation’ and ‘procuring organisation’ the actual name of the organisation can be substituted here eg department of expenditure c name of custom field and existing value ‘the legal head’ and ‘head of the procuring organisation’ the head of the organisation usually is the authority that appoints arbitrators and conciliators the authoritys actual designation for such appointments can be substituted here eg jt secretary d name of custom field and existing value ‘procuring entity’ and ‘procuring entity’ this entity floats the tender the actual name of such entity can be substituted here eg procurement policy division e name of custom field and existing value ‘head of procurement’ and ‘head of procurement’ the head of the procuring entity is usually the competent financial authority for procurement matters the authoritys actual designation for such procurement powers can be substituted here eg general manager procurement f name of custom field and existing value ‘eprocurement url’ and ‘httpseprocuregovineprocureapp’ this field is the url address of the e procurement portal used by the organisation if different than this the actual url used by the organisation can be substituted here g name of custom field and existing value ‘tender inviting authority’ and ‘tender inviting authority’ this officer named tia in the portal uploads the tender document and is the nodal officer interacting with the eprocurement portal if more than one tias are there then do this modification for each specific procurement document and not in the organisation’s model tender document otherwise actual designation for such function can be substituted here eg dy manager h since such changes are not likely to page pagination there is no need to update the table of content i after making these modifications save the file under a suitable name as the model tender document for your organisation this model rfp can be used in all future procurements of goods in the organisation 5 customise model tender document for a specific type of tender process 51 the model tender document and as it stands is customised for single stage two covers domestic open tenders through gepnic eprocurement of general goods with suitable customisation it can be used for capital goods ratecontract tendercum auction single cover or the second stage of twostage prequalification

information 53 instead of two covers system of tendering a single cover system make changes in the following sections of the model tender document a appendix to nit tis – in 10 basic details – no of covers b section iii aitb – in itb 1222 53 instead of a singlestage bidding system the second stage of twostage pre qualification bidding pqb after shortlisting of qualified bidders in the eoi pqb stage make changes in the following sections of the model tender document a appendix to nit tis – in 10 basic details – bidding system b section iii aitb – in itb 1222 54 instead of open tender domestic a global tender enquiry make changes in the following sections of the model tender document a appendix to nit tis – in 10 basic details – tender type b section iii aitb – in itb 616 and 1242 here any other detail like currencies allowed to be quoted etc may be added 55 if an ereverse auction is to follow the usual financial bid opening in tender cumauction system make changes in the following sections of the model tender document a appendix to nit tis – in 10 basic details – ereverse auction b section iii aitb – in itb 1243 here any other relevant details may be added 56 procurement of capital goods machinery and plant special provisions are needed in case of such procurements make changes in the following sections of the model tender document a appendix to nit tis – in 10 basic details – tender category b section iii aitb – in itb 613 here any other relevant details may be added c section v scc – in gcc 61 66 67 also mention any incidental works services required

authority’ if your organisation has different tias for different tenders then the actual designation of the tia should be modified for each specific procurement as per para 4 g above otherwise don’t change this field b name of custom field and existing value ‘subject matter of procurement’ and ‘goods’ a short description of the goods being procured is mentioned in the headers and at other places in the tender document substitute here the short description of goods being procured eg printer paper a4 white 75 gsm the procurement of goods guidance note for the goods model tender document v rate contract tender process should mention ‘to enter into rate contracts for the supply of name of the goods’ c name of custom field and existing value ‘document number’ and ‘tend no xxxx’ tender reference number is mentioned in the headers and at other places in the tender document substitute the actual tender number here you would not have to type this information repeatedly 7 filling data for a specific procurement 71 portions that need not be modified for a specific procurement a significant portion 75 of the model tender document need not be modified for a specific procurement these portions are a section i notice inviting tender nit the nit provides sufficient information to bidders to help in deciding on participation it gets customised through the custom fields as in para 4 and 6 above it is designed to separate variable information in its appendix – tender information summary tis tis also serves as a central repository of tender parameters along with aitb appendix to itb therefore the nit does not require modification for a specific procurement b section ii instructions to bidders itb – it provides instructions and information to bidders regarding the tender process upto letter of award loa itb need not be changed since any changes required are to be entered in section iii appendix to itb aitb c section iv general conditions of contract gcc it contains standard conditions of the contract it is designed to be selfcontained without reference to other sections except scc gcc need not be changed since any changes required are to be entered in section v special conditions of contract scc d all bidding forms are to be filled by the bidders and hence should be left unchanged e all formats also are to be left unchanged 72 portions to be filled in for a specific procurement a small portion approx 10 of the model tender document need to be modified for a specific procurement these are f tender information summary tis appendix to nit contains variable information of the nit it supplements aitb in providing salient parameters of tender in tabular form which used to be earlier interspersed all over the older tender documents sufficient guidance is written in the tis to guide you in filling it also see para 5 above g section iii aitb modifies the standard provisions of itb sufficient guidance is written in the aitb to guide you in filling it also see para 5 above h section v scc modifies the standard provisions of gcc sufficient guidance is written in the scc to guide you in filling it also see para 5 above i there are specific clauses that act like doubleedged swords and are appropriate only for restricted procurement situations their use in regular procurement may enhance risk perception and quoted prices by the bidder without any commensurate benefit to the procuring entity these clauses are enabled as dormant and shall not apply unless expressly invoked in the scc so if warranted explicitly enable these eg in the case of rate contract para 57 above fall clause should be expressly invoked • gccclause 510 book examination clause this is too onerous for the bidder and is rarely used and may be relevant only for an exceptionally high guidance note for the goods model tender document vi value procurement where undue profiteering is an assessed risk the bidder would hedge his prices for the perceived costs and disruptions • gccclause 512 labour codes and related obligations this usually is not relevant in the procurement of goods except rarely in large capital goods procurements involving a significant presence of contractor’s personnel during installation and testing • gccclause 65 quantity option clause this may be useful for repetitive annual longterm procurements where quantity forecast has large variability in inappropriate situations the bidder may hedge his prices for the uncertainty in quantity • gccclause 1016 fall clause this may be useful in longterm procurements eg ratecontracts for goods procured by many agencies or where prices typically decrease due to technological trends in inappropriate situations it may prevent the bidders from passing the benefits of a downward trend of prices in subsequent procurements j section vi schedules of requirements specifies scope of supplies delivery terms delivery schedule logistics requirements section vi may be filled to reflect the complete scope of the requirement the requirements may consist of more than one schedule each schedule may contain more than one goods description of goods here should be detailed enough but should leave technical aspects to section vii technical specifications and quality assurance pay special attention if incidental works services are included especially in capital goods machinery plant para 56 above k section vii technical specifications quality assurance mentions the technical specifications and quality assurance requirements mention here warranty obligations environmental compliance energysaving requirements eg bee star classification etc if not covered elsewhere in tender documents mention type of inspection inspection agency tests required etc if not covered in technical specification l section viii qualification criteria details the qualification criteria distinguished from the eligibility criteria mentioned in nitclause 3 qualification criteria should be commensurate with the expertise required to supply goods to required standards and quality since unduly onerous qualification criteria would restrict competition and lead to higher prices if the procurement is minor or routine qualification criteria may be simplified guidance is provided in filling this schedule in the model rfp please refer to annexure 9 as amended to date of the manual for procurement of goods 2017 for further guidance also mention if any and to what extent dispensation from qualification criteria shall be permissible for startups under itb 4322 and to mii jvs under itb 4182 pay special attention in the case of capital goods machinery plant and rate contracts where detailed qualification criteria would be required m after this the customisation of the tender document
